# TIC TAC TOE Game using Flowgorithm

This repository contains the implementation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe using Flowgorithm, a flowchart-based programming tool. The game is designed to be played in the console, allowing users to enjoy the familiar gameplay of Tic Tac Toe.

## Flowgorithm Tool

Flowgorithm is a free application used to create flowcharts. It allows developers to visualize the flow of their programs, making it easier to design and understand algorithms. The Tic Tac Toe game in this repository is implemented using Flowgorithm, making it accessible to individuals who want to learn the game's logic in a visual way.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/Krishna-Nerella/tic-tac-toe-flowgorithm.git

2. Open the Flowgorithm tool on your machine.

3. Load the `tic_tac_toe.fprg` file from the cloned repository using the Flowgorithm tool.

4. Run the program in the Flowgorithm tool, and the Tic Tac Toe game will start in the console.

5. The game will prompt the players to take turns, asking for their move in the format of row and column numbers (e.g., "1 1" for the top-left corner).

6. The game will display the updated board after each move and continue until there is a winner or a draw.

## Features

- **Simple Console Interface:** The game is played in the console, allowing easy interaction with the players.

- **Error Handling:** The program includes error handling to prevent invalid inputs and handle any unexpected scenarios.

- **Win Detection:** The game correctly detects a win or a draw, announcing the result when the game is over.

## Contributing

Contributions to the game are welcome! If you'd like to add features, improve the code, or fix any issues, feel free to create a pull request explaining your changes. Please ensure that your contributions align with the project's style and adhere to the established flowchart logic.

## Acknowledgments

This game is a simple project created using the Flowgorithm tool, inspired by the classic Tic Tac Toe game. Special thanks to the developers of Flowgorithm for providing this intuitive programming tool.

Enjoy the game and happy coding!
